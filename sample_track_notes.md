6. Play along with Salsa tunes using basic montunos, following chords in chart
7. Transcribe the unique montuno that they are using on the Coro(s)
  NOTE:  This is a repetitive pattern that varies some, but has a hypnotic repetition, and helps identify the unique song and coro.  People expect it as part of recognizing that song. Although you can still play the Coro montuno differently, if you play it with strong clave feeling.
  NOTE: You'll find that there is a one line melody that weaves through the chords. This one line melody is surrounded by typical montuno patterns. As you get familiar with basic montunos and keeping the clave beat, you'll be able to recall the coro montuno using just the "one liner", while your hands and skills complete the rest.
